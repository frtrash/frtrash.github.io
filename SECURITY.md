# AuraX Security

Security matters to us. If you’re digging around AuraX and notice something that looks off or could be abused — tell us. We’d rather fix it early than miss it.

## How to Report

If you find something serious, like a way to access user data, bypass limits, or break stuff that shouldn’t break:


Use GitHub’s private advisory feature if you prefer.
or DM me in discord -->

Please don’t post it publicly until we’ve had time to review and respond.

## What You Can Report

We're interested in anything that affects the security or integrity of:

- Any page we host (`index.html`, `games.html`, etc.)
- Firebase (realtime DB, file uploads, authentication)
- The leaderboard system or XP tracker
- Avatar upload or anything tied to user data

---

## What We Don’t Cover

We can’t help with:

- Bugs in external games or links that go outside our site
- Third-party libraries or services we embed
- Anything that’s not hosted by us or tied to Firebase

---

## A Few Ground Rules

Test stuff if you want — poke around, try things. But don’t be a jerk about it.

You’re allowed to:

- Browse the site normally
- Upload harmless test files
- Submit XP or scores like a real user would
- Check Firebase rules (they’re public)

Don’t:

- Spam or flood anything
- Try to access accounts or data that isn’t yours
- Use scripts to brute force or scrape
- Social engineer anyone — that’s just low

---

## After You Report

- We’ll usually reply within a day or two
- If your report is valid, we’ll fix it and keep you updated
- If you want credit, we’ll add you to our security thanks
- If we don’t accept the issue, we’ll explain why

Thanks for helping keep things secure.
AuraX is still under development, so early reports are super valuable.
